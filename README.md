<!-- Its a good practice to have a README file in your project folder. This file should contain information about the project, how to install it and run it etc. -->
**Note**: Below is the sample README for the project.


---
To set up the project, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

For data preprocessing, run the following script:

```bash
bash preprocess_dataset.sh
```

Key Improvements and Explanations:

Environment Variable Handling:
local_rank and total_procs are now correctly retrieved from the environment variables PROC_RANK and TOTAL_PROCS, respectively.
data_path is also retrieved from the environment variable DATA_DIR.

load_dataset Implementation:
The load_dataset function is now implemented to load a specific shard of the C4 dataset using the datasets library.
It takes data_path, shard_index, and num_shards as arguments.
It uses streaming mode to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory.
It returns a list of text strings from the loaded shard.
Basic error handling has been added.

write_preprocessed_text Function:
The write_preprocessed_text function now correctly writes the preprocessed text to the output file, using the provided rank to create a unique filename.
It joins the tokens in each preprocessed line with tabs.

main Function:
The main function now correctly calls load_dataset, preprocess_text, and write_preprocessed_text.
It passes the correct arguments to each function.
The raise NotImplementedError call has been removed.

Path Variables:

The code now uses the DATA_DIR environment variable to determine where the c4 dataset is located.


How to Use:

Save: Save the code as text_preprocessor.py.
Environment Variables: Make sure that the PROC_RANK, TOTAL_PROCS, and DATA_DIR environment variables are set before running the script.
Run: Use your process spawner (super_duper_process_spawner) to run the script in parallel.
